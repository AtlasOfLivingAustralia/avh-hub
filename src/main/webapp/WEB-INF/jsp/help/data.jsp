        ${shortName} data
    </h1>
    <p>
        ${fullName} (${shortName}) is the contribution of Australian herbaria to the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA). Currently, data is delivered to ${shortName}
        by the eight Commonwealth, state and territory herbaria and the Australian Tropical Herbarium. We hope to include records from university herbaria in the near future.
    </p>
    <p>
        Herbarium specimen data is catalogued in accordance with the data entry standards and protocols of each herbarium. The data is then exported to ${shortName} using
        the HISPID (Herbarium Information Systems Protocol for the Interchange of Data) standard. Most contributing herbaria deliver their data to ${shortName}
        dynamically using a <a href="http://www.biocase.org/products/provider_software/">BioCASe provider</a>, which provides new and updated records to ${shortName} on a daily
        basis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once aggregated in the ALA BioCache, the data is further standardised and a range of quality checks are applied to enhance data retrieval and analysis. The
        standardisation and data processing applied in the BioCache is described below. The unprocessed data provided by the herbaria is always available; an
        overview of the provided versus processed data is available for each record via the <a href="help.html#record_detail"><span class="feature">Record detail</span></a> page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Australia’s Virtual Herbarium contains records of the holdings of Australian herbaria, both of Australian and foreign 
        collections. It also contains records of cultivated plants and introduced occurrences and while there is the 
        <i>establishment means</i> field to indicate whether a plant is cultivated or not native, this has not always been 
        used. AVH records may also just be wrong. A record in AVH of a species from a certain location only means that 
        there is a specimen with this species name from the given location, not necessarily that the species naturally 
        occurs at that location. The major asset of AVH is that all records are based on preserved specimens, so they can, 
        to a large extent, be verified. It is up to the user to decide whether or not verification is necessary. By itself 
        AVH data is not more authoritative than data you get from anywhere else.

        An identifier that identifies the physical specimen. In ${shortName}, catalogue numbers consist of the <span class="feature">Herbarium code</span>, followed by a space and then the catalogue
        number used at the institution. The search for catalogue number uses an exact match, so the catalogue number entered needs to be exactly the same as it is
        in ${shortName}. Catalogue number formats applied at the different herbaria are listed in Table 1.

        Note that previous versions of ${shortName} used the term 'Accession number' instead of catalogue number.
    </p>
    <h3>
        ALA record ID
    </h3>
    <p>
        The unique identifier applied to the specimen record in the ALA BioCache. The <span class="feature">ALA record ID</span> is listed in the <a href="help.html#downloads"><span class="feature">CSV downloads</span></a> and in the URL of the <a href="help.html#record_detail"><span class="feature">Record detail</span></a> page. You can use the <span class="feature">ALA record ID</span> to find the most up-to-date data for the specimen record by typing '${hostname}/[record
        ID]' in the navigation bar of your browser.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Basis of record
    </h3>
    <p>
        <span class="feature">Basis of record</span> describes the source of the information in a record. Occurrence records are generally either based on an object (such as a preserved
        specimen), or on an observation of an organism in the field. Object-based records are more verifiable than observation-based records, because the specimens
        are held in permanent collections and can be examined at a later date and the identification can be verified. All ${shortName} records are based on objects.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Preparations
    </h3>
    <p>
        The preparation type of the specimen ('Sheet', 'Packet' etc.).
    </p>
    <h3>
        Date last updated
    </h3>
    <p>
        The date the record was last updated. On the <a href="help.html#record_detail"><span class="feature">Record detail</span></a> pages this is shown as <span class="feature">Date loaded</span> and will appear under the location map. The <span class="feature">Date last processed</span> indicates when the record was last processed within the ALA BioCache. This may happen, for instance, when there is a change in the backbone
        taxonomy or the Sensitive Data Service, or when new environmental layers are loaded.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Collecting event
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Collector
    </h3>
    <p>
        The name of the collector, as provided with the specimen record.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Collecting number
    </h3>
    <p>
        The number (or other identifier) assigned to the specimen by the collector.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Additional collectors
    </h3>
    <p>
        The names of any additional collectors who were present at the time the specimen was collected.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Collecting date
    </h3>
    <p>
        The date that the specimen was collected. Collecting dates in ${shortName} are delivered in two ways: as <span class="feature">Collecting date</span>, which has to be ISO compliant, or as
        <span class="feature">Verbatim collecting date</span>. Some herbaria deliver <span class="feature">Verbatim collecting date</span> only when an ISO-compliant <span class="feature">Collecting date</span> can't be delivered, or not all information can be delivered as an ISO-compliant date (e.g. 'Summer of '69'), while others deliver it for all collecting dates. Because of database
        restrictions, some herbaria are only able to deliver incomplete collecting dates as <span class="feature">Verbatim collecting date</span>. We hope to remedy this in the near future.
    </p>
    <p>
        Approximately six per cent of ${shortName} specimen records are undated. These will predominantly be historical (pre-1900) records, but will also include records
        collected in the twentieth century.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Querying by date
    </h4>
    <p>
        The <span class="feature">Collecting date</span> term in the <a href="help.html#advanced_search"><span class="feature">Advanced search</span></a> form allows you to query for a range of collecting dates. If you enter just a start date or an end date,
        your results will include records of specimens collected since or up to that date respectively. To query for a particular collecting date, enter the same
        date in both fields. Because of problems associated with querying incomplete dates, the results for a search that includes a collecting date term will only
        return records with complete collecting dates.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Date facets
    </h4>
    <p>
        There are <span class="feature">Year</span>, <span class="feature">Month</span> and <span class="feature">Decade</span> facets on the <a href="help.html#results"><span class="feature">Results</span></a> page that allow you to filter your results for records collected in a particular year, month or
        decade. Note that the <span class="feature">Decade</span> facet and chart only include records with complete collecting dates; records with only a month and a year, or just a year,
        will not be counted.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Locality
    </h3>
    <p>
        The locality at which the specimen was collected.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Habitat
    </h3>
    <p>
        A description of the habitat that the plant, alga or fungus was growing in, provided by the collector(s) of the specimen. Some herbarium databases have
        this information split into multiple fields, e.g. 'Habitat', 'Associated taxa', 'Substrate' and 'Host', but the information from the separate fields is
        concatenated before being delivered to ${shortName}.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Collecting notes
    </h3>
    <p>
        Any additional notes about the specimen or the collecting event provided by the collector. Some herbaria store this information in multiple fields in their
        herbarium databases, for example 'Collecting notes' and 'Descriptive notes', but this information is concatenated for delivery to ${shortName}. Some herbarium
        databases have a general notes field and no other place to store notes from determiners or data entry personnel &ndash; and even those that do have dedicated
        fields for other types of notes have not always had them &ndash; so, for many records, <span class="feature">Collecting notes</span> will contain more than just collecting notes.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Phenology
    </h3>
    <p>
        The <span class="feature">Phenology</span> field indicates whether the specimen is bearing flowers or fruits, etc. Only two herbaria, MEL and NSW, deliver this information.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Establishment means
    </h3>
    <p>
        <span class="feature">Establishment means</span> describes how the specimen was established at the collecting locality. It combines the HISPID concepts 'Cultivation status' and
        'Natural occurrence'. Cultivation status can be one of the following values: 'Cultivated', 'Not cultivated', 'Assumed to be cultivated' and 'Doubtfully
        cultivated'. Cultivation status is not recorded consistently among the different herbaria, and is not provided by all herbaria. Natural occurrence
        indicates whether the occurrence is natural or whether the specimen has been introduced at the collecting locality. Allowed values are: 'Native', 'Assumed
        to be native', 'Doubtfully native' and 'Not native'. This information is recorded rather haphazardly.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Conservation status
    </h3>
    <p>
        The conservation status associated with the taxon in the state or territory in which it was collected. The classification codes for each state or territory
        are listed in Table 2.

    <h2>
        Taxonomy
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Taxon names in ${shortName}
    </h3>
    <p>
        The ALA applies taxon name resolution to incoming data. The taxon name with a record will be stored in the ALA BioCache exactly as it is delivered to ${shortName} &ndash;
        called <span class="feature">Taxon name (provided)</span> in ${shortName} &ndash; but the taxon name will also be processed. The processing of the taxon name includes parsing the name into its parts,
        e.g. genus name and epithet(s). If the name can be parsed, the name resolver will try to match the canonical name against the ALA name list. If no match
        can be found or the name could not be parsed, it will try to match the genus name; if the genus name is not in the ALA name list, it will try to match the
        name of the family, which is provided separately.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a matched name is in one of the authoritative national checklists that are part of the ALA name list, such as the <a href="http://www.anbg.gov.au/chah/apc/">Australian Plant Census</a> (APC), and if
        the matched name is considered a synonym, the processed name will be the accepted name from the checklist. The processed taxon name is called <span class="feature">Taxon name (processed)</span> in ${shortName}.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <span class="feature">Taxon rank (matched)</span> is the rank of the processed taxon name. This may be the same rank as the rank of the provided name, or a higher rank. If the rank
        of the processed name is different from that of the provided name, and the name resolver can work out the rank of the provided name, the rank of the
        provided name will be given on the <a href="help.html#record_detail"><span class="feature">Record detail</span></a> page as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <span class="feature">Name match metric</span> describes how the provided name was matched to a name in the ALA name list. If the parsed name was matched, the <span class="feature">Name match metric</span>
        will be 'Canonical name match'. 'Higher taxa match' means that the name itself could not be matched, but the name of a higher taxon &ndash; genus or family &ndash;
        could. 'No match' means that neither the provided name nor the name of a higher taxon could be matched to a name in the ALA name list.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="feature">Author</span> is the authorship of the processed name. The authorship of the provided name is given as part of <span class="feature">Taxon name (provided)</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <span class="feature">Common name</span> is the common name recorded in the ALA name list. Common names are never provided by the herbaria.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Classification
    </h3>
    <p>
        There are facets for taxonomic groups of all mandatory ranks &ndash; <span class="feature">Kingdom</span>, <span class="feature">Phylum</span>, <span class="feature">Class</span>, <span class="feature">Order</span>, <span class="feature">Family</span>, <span class="feature">Genus</span>, <span class="feature">Species</span> &ndash; and for <span class="feature">Infraspecific taxon</span>. These
        taxonomic groups are also given on the <a href="help.html#record_detail"><span class="feature">Record detail</span></a> page and in the <a href="help.html#downloads"><span class="feature">CSV downloads</span></a>. If there was no match for a provided name, the names of the taxonomic
        groups provided with the specimen record will be displayed.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Botanical group
    </h3>
    <p>
        The <span class="feature">Botanical group</span> facet allows you to select records of a botanical group that is not necessarily a taxonomic group, for example, bryophytes, angiosperms
        or dicotyledons. Some other useful groupings, e.g. lichens, have not been implemented yet, but will be added when the National Species Lists have been
        completed. As these are not taxonomic groups, botanical groups may overlap and not all taxa are represented in one of the recognised groups.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Determination qualifier
    </h3>
    <p>
        The <span class="feature">Determination qualifier</span> facet can be used to select records with certain determination qualifiers, or to exclude records with uncertain determination.
        Note that excluding records with uncertain determination disqualifies all records with determination qualifiers, no matter at what rank the qualifier
        applies. If a qualifier applies at the infraspecific rank you might want to include the determination in the results of a taxon name query. In this case
        you are better off keeping the uncertain determinations and deleting the ones that you don't want from the output, or do a filter on uncertain
        determinations and see what you are going to throw out.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Addendum
    </h3>
    <p>
        The taxon name addendum is a qualifier that comes after the taxon name. Name addenda endorsed by HISPID (translated in proper English) are 's. str.' (in
        the narrow sense), 's.l.' (in the broad sense) and 'agg.' (aggregate, group, complex). The first two are supposed to be used to differentiate between
        competing taxon concepts, but s.l. is often used to indicate uncertainty about whether the specimen belongs to the taxon in question, or if it belongs to a
        similar taxon. In this case, 'agg.' would have been more appropriate to use. Often aggregates are not formally recognised, although there is mostly general
        agreement on what the complexes are. For general use it is probably best to ignore 's. str.' and treat determinations with the other name addenda as
        uncertain determinations.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Determiner
    </h3>
    <p>
        The person or persons who last determined the specimen. Due to the practice at some Australian herbaria of changing the name on specimens as part of the
        curatorial process, without examining the specimen, a lot of this information is meaningless or even misleading.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Determiner role
    </h3>
    <p>
        The role the determiner has played in the determination, e.g. determined the specimen ('Det.') or confirmed an earlier determination ('Conf.').
    </p>
    <h3>
        Determination date
    </h3>
    <p>
        The <span class="feature">Determination date</span> term in the <a href="help.html#advanced_search"><span class="feature">Advanced search</span></a> allows you to query for a range of determination dates. If you fill in just a start date or an end date, your results
        will include records of specimens determined since or up to that date respectively. In order to query for a particular determination date, enter the same
        date in both fields. Because of problems associated with querying incomplete dates, a result for a search that includes a determination date term will only
        include records with complete determination dates. It is common practice to give only a month and year on determination slips, so be aware that a large
        part of the determinations will be missed when querying by determination date.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Determination notes
    </h3>
    <p>
        <span class="feature">Determination notes</span> are any notes that are made by the determiner at the time of the determination. These may include diagnostic features, a reference to
        the work that was used to identify the specimen, or an indication that the specimen is not typical for the taxon. Due to the structure of some herbarium
        databases, determination notes have often been included in <span class="feature">Collecting notes</span>.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Type status
    </h3>
    <p>
        The type status of any type specimens in the results. Note that, if you searched by a taxon name, a type specimen in the result is not necessarily a type
        of the name that you searched for.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Geography
    </h2>
    <p>
        The values in many of the following geography fields have been inferred from the latitude and longitude provided with the specimen records. In some cases,
        the geography values stored in the herbarium record may differ from the inferred values due to geocoding errors. If you suspect that there is an error with
        a record, you can flag an issue on the <a href="help.html#record_detail"><span class="feature">Record detail</span></a> page.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Country
    </h3>
    <p>
        The country in which the specimen was collected. Note that, while most Australian herbaria hold specimens collected outside Australia, only a small
        proportion of foreign holdings have been databased and made available through ${shortName}.
    </p>
    <h3>
        State or territory
    </h3>
    <p>
        The state or territory that Australian specimens were collected in. Queries for records from countries other than Australia cannot be limited to political
        divisions below the country level.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Local government area
    </h3>
    <p>
        The local government area in which the specimen was collected, based on the latitude and longitude provided with the specimen record.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Latitude and longitude
    </h3>
    <p>
        The latitude and longitude of the collecting locality. If correctable errors are detected, for example the latitude or longitude is in the wrong hemisphere
        or the latitude and longitude are transposed, the values are corrected and the unprocessed latitude and longitude are given in the <span class="feature">Latitude (provided)</span> and
        <span class="feature">Longitude (provided)</span> fields in the <a href="help.html#record_detail"><span class="feature">Record detail</span></a> page and in downloaded results.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Geodetic datum
    </h3>
    <p>
        The geodetic datum is the reference from which the latitude and longitude are measured. The most common datums are WGS84, GDA94 and AGD66. While important
        for records of more recent collections, the inaccuracy of the georeferences in the bulk of the ${shortName} records is much greater than the differences between the
        different datums. <span class="feature">Geodetic datum</span> is very haphazardly delivered with ${shortName} data, even with georeferences that are accurate enough for the geodetic datum to be
        meaningful.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Geocode uncertainty
    </h3>
    <p>
        The <span class="feature">Geocode uncertainty</span> is a measurement or estimate of how far away in metres the point represented by the latitude and longitude may be from the actual
        location where the specimen was collected. Most herbaria use ranges in their collections databases, for example 0-100 m, 100 m-1 km, 1-10 km, 10-25 km and
        &gt;25 km. The values that are delivered to ${shortName} are the maximum values of these ranges.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Georeferencing method
    </h3>
    <p>
        The method by which the georeference was obtained, for example by GPS or by using a topographic map. In the HISPID standard, which is used for data
        delivery to ${shortName}, 'Geocode source' is a mixed concept and includes both generalisations for the method used and for the person who provided the
        georeference. In ${shortName}, the terms that refer to the person who provided the georeference are stored under <span class="feature">Georeferenced by</span>.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Georeferenced by
    </h3>
    <p>
        A general term for the person who provided the georeference ('Collector' or 'Compiler').
    </p>
    <h3>
        Altitude
    </h3>
    <p>
        The altitude in metres of the collecting locality, if provided with the specimen record. Altitude is presented in ${shortName} as <span class="feature">Minimum altitude (m)</span> and <span class="feature">Maximum altitude (m)</span>. If a single value for altitude is provided, which will mostly be the case, this will be given as <span class="feature">Minimum altitude (m)</span>. If a range is provided a
        <span class="feature">Maximum altitude (m)</span> will also be given.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Depth
    </h3>
    <p>
        The depth in metres where the specimen was collected. Depth is presented in ${shortName} as <span class="feature">Minimum depth (m)</span> and <span class="feature">Maximum depth (m)</span>. If a single value for depth is provided, which will mostly be the case, this will be given as <span class="feature">Minimum depth (m)</span>. If a range is provided a <span class="feature">Maximum depth (m)</span> will also be given.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Ecoregion

    <p>
        The ecoregion (non-marine, marine, or limnetic) in which the taxon occurs. The data comes from the <a href="http://www.obis.org.au/irmng/">Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG)</a> and is based on the genus name, not from the latitude and longitude associated with the record. Not all genus names in ${shortName} are in IRMNG.

    <p>
        The herbaria to which duplicates have been sent. Herbaria are identified by their <a href="http://sweetgum.nybg.org/ih/"> Index Herbariorum</a>
        acronym. When querying this field, note that the specimen records in the results will be from the herbarium that sent the duplicates, not the herbaria that
        received the duplicates. A potential use case of the <span class="feature">Duplicates sent to</span> query term in the <a href="help.html#advanced_search"><span class="feature">Advanced search</span></a> would be a herbarium trying to find the original records of specimens they have received on exchange from all other Australian herbaria, or, if used in combination with the <span class="feature">Herbarium field</span>, from one particular Australian herbarium.
    </p>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p>
        The herbarium from which the specimen was received. In most cases, but not all, this will be the herbarium where the original specimen is held. Herbaria
        are identified by their <a href="http://sweetgum.nybg.org/ih/"> Index Herbariorum</a> acronym.

    <p>
        When ${shortName} data is uploaded into the BioCache, a range of quality assurance checks are performed and potential data issues are flagged. Some data issues
        (such as transposed or negated latitude and longitude) will result in the data being modified; other issues will simply be flagged. The details of any
        changes made during processing can be viewed by clicking on the <a href="help.html#original_vs_processed"><span class="feature">Original vs Processed</span></a> button on the <a href="help.html#record_detail"><span class="feature">Record detail</span></a> page. Users can also flag potential issues with specimen records by using the <a href="help.html#flag_an_issue"><span class="feature">Flag an issue</span></a> feature on the <a href="help.html#record_detail"><span class="feature">Record detail</span></a> page. Data issues detected during processing or flagged by users are available as a facet on the <a href="help.html#results"><span class="feature">Results</span></a> page, and can be used to narrow down your search results. The range of data issues in ${shortName} are described in Table 3. The data issues are also available on the <a href="help.html#record_detail"><span class="feature">Record detail</span></a> page and in the <a href="help.html#downloads"><span class="feature">CSV downloads</span></a>.

    <h3>
        Spatial validity
    </h3>
    <p>
        An assessment of whether or not the location is spatially valid, based on a range of data quality checks and user-contributed annotations. If the record suffers from one or more of the geospatial <span class="feature">Data issues</span> listed in Table 2 it is considered 'Spatially suspect', otherwise it is 'Spatially valid'. Note that a 'Spatially valid' record is not necessarily correctly georeferenced, and, depending on
        the data issue, a 'Spatially suspect' record is not necessarily incorrectly georeferenced.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Outliers
    </h3>
    <p>
        Outliers are observations that are distant from the rest of the data in a sample. In ${shortName} the sample is observations of a taxon. The presence of outliers
        might indicate that specimens (the outliers) have been incorrectly identified or georeferenced, but also that the distribution is skewed or disjunct, or
        that the taxon has been under-collected in certain areas. Checks for outliers in ${shortName} are done using five climate surfaces: precipitation seasonality,
        precipitation of the driest quarter, radiation seasonality, radiation of the warmest quarter and mean moisture index of the quarter with the highest
        moisture index. The tests are conducted only where there are 20 or more unique locations for a taxon. For more information on how the tests are done, see
        the notes on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ala-dataquality/wiki/DETECTED_OUTLIER_JACKKNIFE">spatial outlier detection method</a> used by ALA.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <span class="feature">Outlier for layer</span> facet indicates if a specimen is an outlier for an environmental layer, based on the known environmental range of the taxon to which
        the specimen has been identified. The <span class="feature">Outlier layer count</span> facet allows you to filter your results for records that are outliers for certain numbers of
        environmental layers. You can also display your results by <span class="feature">Outlier for layer</span> or <span class="feature">Outlier layer count</span> on the distribution map. If a record is an outlier for one or
        more layers, the <a href="help.html#record_detail"><span class="feature">Record detail</span></a> page will display graphs for each of the variables for which the record is an outlier with the distribution of the records
        of the taxon to which it belongs. The layers for which a record is an outlier will also be given in the <a href="help.html#downloads"><span class="feature">CSV downloads</span></a>.

    <h2>
        Sensitive data
    </h2>
    <p>
        Australia's Virtual Herbarium contains data that may be considered sensitive because of conservation or biosecurity issues. The
        <a href="http://www.ala.org.au/faq/data-sensitivity/">ALA Sensitive Data Service</a>
        contains authoritative lists of taxa that are considered sensitive, obtained in collaboration with Commonwealth, state and territory agencies and data
        providers, with information on how data of these taxa should be handled for each state. Distribution data for these sensitive taxa may be either withheld
        or generalised. The latter means that instead of a detailed locality the local government area will be given and that the latitude and longitude will be
        rounded to, for example, a single decimal place. Currently, distribution data is only completely withheld for a single native species, the Wollemi Pine
        (<i>Wollemia nobilis</i>). There is a <span class="feature">Sensitive data</span> facet that can be used to check for sensitive data among query results. The <a href="help.html#record_detail"><span class="feature">Record detail</span></a> page and the <a href="help.html#downloads"><span class="feature">CSV downloads</span></a> indicate whether distribution data has been withheld or generalised for each record.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Multimedia
    </h2>
    <p>
        The <span class="feature">Multimedia</span> facet allows you to filter your results for records that have images or other multimedia attached. Currently, there are no records with
        multimedia in ${shortName}, but we aim to get some in in the very near future.
