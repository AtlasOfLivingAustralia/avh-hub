    <h2>
        Registration and login
    </h2>
    <p>
        No registration or login is needed to access or download data from ${fullName} . All data, except for data of certain taxa that are
        sensitive for conservation or biosecurity reasons, is accessible to everyone. We do, however, encourage all users to register, as registration makes some
        extra features available. You need to be logged in to report an issue with an ${shortName} record and to sign up for e-mail alerts. Also, ${shortName} remembers some of your
        preferences during your session and, if you log in, stores a cookie on your machine, so your session lasts until the cookie expires or is deleted.
        Registrations for ${shortName} are no longer vetted. ${shortName} is part of the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), so if you already have an ALA user account, you don't need
        to register separately for ${shortName}, but can log in using your ALA account details.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Search
    </h2>
    <p>
        There are five main search options for querying ${shortName} data. The <span class="feature">Quick search</span> allows you to quickly perform a search using a single search term. The <span class="feature">Advanced
        search</span> allows you to perform a more structured query using one or more criteria. The <span class="feature">Batch name search</span> and <span class="feature">Batch catalogue number search</span> allow you to query
        by multiple taxon names and multiple catalogue numbers respectively. The <span class="feature">Shapefile search</span> allows you to query by a polygon defined in a shapefile.
    </p>
    <p>
        Information on how the different search options work is provided below. See the <a href="data.html"><span class="feature">Data</span></a> page for descriptions of the data associated with each of the query
        terms.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Quick search
    </h3>
    <p>
        The <span class="feature">Quick search</span> first attempts to match the search term against a standard list of botanical names and common names. If no matches are found, a match will
        be attempted against the taxon names provided with the specimen records. If there is still no match, a full text search will be performed against the
        following fields: <a href="data.html#herbarium"><span class="feature">Herbarium name</span></a>, <a href="data.html#herbarium_code"><span class="feature">Herbarium
                code</span></a>, <a href="data.html#catalogue_number"><span class="feature">Catalogue number</span></a>, <a href="data.html#collector"><span class="feature">Collector</span></a>,
        <a href="data.html#determiner"><span class="feature">Determiner</span></a> and <a href="data.html#collecting_notes"><span class="feature">Collecting notes</span></a>.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Advanced search
    </h3>
    <p>
        The <span class="feature">Advanced search</span> allows you to perform a structured query using one or more criteria. The data fields you can query on are explained in some detail on
        the <a href="data.html"><span class="feature">Data</span></a> page.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Taxon name
    </h4>
    <p>
        The <span class="feature">Taxon name search</span> attempts to match the search term against a standard list of botanical names and common names. If no matches are found, a match will
        be attempted against the taxon names provided with the specimen records (<a href="data.html#taxon_names_in_${shortName}"><span class="feature">Taxon name (provided)</span></a>). The taxon name search term can be combined with other
        search terms in the <span class="feature">Advanced search</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Taxon names can be botanical names of any rank, or common names. Common names are not provided with the ${shortName} data and are not a reliable means of querying
        ${shortName} records.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can enter up to four taxon names in the <span class="feature">Advanced search</span>. If you want to query on more than four taxon names at the one time, use the <span class="feature">Batch name search</span>;
        you can then use the facets on the results page to add more search terms to your query.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Full text search
    </h4>
    <p>
        Unlike the other items in the <span class="feature">Advanced search</span> tab, <span class="feature">Full text search</span> will try
        to locate the entered string in a number of fields. These include <a href="data.html#herbarium"><span class="feature">Herbarium name</span></a>,
        <a href="data.html#herbarium_code"><span class="feature">Herbarium code</span></a>, <a href="data.html#catalogue_number"><span class="feature">Catalogue number</span></a>,
        <a href="data.html#collector"><span class="feature">Collector</span></a>,
        <a href="data.html#determiner"><span class="feature">Determiner</span></a> and <a href="data.html#collecting_notes"><span class="feature">Collecting notes</span></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <span class="feature">Full text search</span> will match the parts of the search string to entire words, but you can add a wildcard ('*') to the last part of the string to match to
        the start of words. By default, the <span class="feature">Full text search</span> will split the search string into its parts and will match to strings where the matched words are
        separated from each other by text or are in a different order than the parts of the search string. To avoid this behaviour you can enclose the search
        string in double quotes. Wildcards in quoted strings will be ignored. Individual words in a search string will be matched to pluralised forms of the word.
        For example, 'cow' will return records with 'cows' in it.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Batch name search
    </h3>
    <p>
        The <span class="feature">Batch name search</span> allows you to perform a query against a list of taxon names. Each taxon name needs to be entered on a separate line in the query box.
    </p>
    <p>
        The list of names entered in the <span class="feature">Batch name search</span> are matched against the unprocessed taxon names provided with the specimen records (<span class="feature">Taxon name
                (provided)</span>). The <span class="feature">Taxon name (provided)</span> for infraspecific taxa may include authors after the species name, and may use inconsistent abbreviations for the
        infraspecific rank ('subsp.', 'ssp.' etc.). Because of this, you will get the most predictable results from a batch name search if you don't include author
        names or names of infraspecific taxa in your list of taxon names. You can then further refine your results using the facets, or by downloading the data and
        removing any unwanted records.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike the single taxon name searches, the <span class="feature">Batch name search</span> only queries on <a href="data.html#taxon_names_in_${shortName}"><span class="feature">Taxon name (provided)</span></a>
        and will not include synonyms in the results. Therefore, for complete results, all known synonyms need to be included in the batch of names.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Batch catalogue number search
    </h3>
    <p>
        The <span class="feature">Batch catalogue number search</span> allows you to perform a query against a list of catalogue numbers. Each catalogue number needs to be entered on a
        separate line in the query box. Catalogue numbers must be formatted exactly as they are stored in ${shortName}; see the <a href="data.html#catalogue_number"><span class="feature">Data page</span></a>
        for a summary of the catalogue number formats used by different herbaria.

                />
    </div>
    <h3>
        Shapefile search
    </h3>
    <p>
        The <span class="feature">Shapefile search</span> allows you to upload an ESRI shapefile and perform a polygon search. Please note that a search is performed only on the first polygon
        encountered in the shapefile. You will need a tool like OGR Info to find out which polygon is on top. There is also a good chance that the area of interest
        consists of more than one polygon in the shapefile. A more comprehensive polygon search can be found in the
        <a href="http://spatial.ala.org.au/">ALA spatial portal</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Auto-complete suggestions
    </h3>
    <p>
        In the <span class="feature">Quick search</span> and the <span class="feature">Taxon name</span> input in the <span class="feature">Advanced search</span>, when you start typing, a drop-down list with suggestions for taxon names will appear.
        These names come from the ALA name list and, although they are only names of plants, fungi and algae, do not necessarily correspond with names in ${shortName}. The
        correspondence between names on the ALA name list and names in ${shortName} will improve when the National Species Lists have been completed.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Results
    </h2>
    <p>
        There are three main options for viewing the results of a query: as a list of records, as a distribution map, and as a series of charts that display
        certain facets of the results. You can narrow down the results of your initial search by selecting values from the facets in the <span class="feature">Refine results</span> menu
        on the left-hand side of the page, and the results displayed in the records, map and charts tab will be updated accordingly.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Refine results
    </h3>
    <p>
        The facets in the <span class="feature">Refine results</span> menu can be used to apply additional search criteria to your result set. Only the first three values will be listed
        under each of the facet titles on the Results page, but you can view all values in a pop-up window by clicking on 'choose more'. If there are more than 100
        values in the facet, only the first 100 values will initially be loaded, but the next 100 values will load when you scroll to the bottom of the window. By
        clicking on the column headers you can order the values in a facet alphabetically by value or by decreasing number of records. You can filter by a single
        value by clicking on that value. You can also use the checkboxes to select up to 15 values and either include only records with the selected values in the
        results or exclude those records from the results.

    <p>
        The <span class="feature">Records</span> tab provides a summary of each specimen record. The most recently published (or edited) records will appear at the top of the list (note that
        these are not necessarily the most recently collected specimens). Clicking on an individual record will open the Record detail page, which provides all
        available data for that record.

        The <span class="feature">Record detail</span> page displays comprehensive specimen data for a single record. The content of the different fields is described on the Data
        page. Date loaded (which appears under the location map) indicates the date the record was provided to the ALA BioCache. Date loaded will change if the
        specimen record has been edited at the source institution. The Date last processed indicates the date that the record was last changed within the ALA
        BioCache. This may happen, for instance, when there is a change in the backbone taxonomy or the Sensitive Data Service, or when new environmental layers
        are loaded, and thus doesn't represent any change to the specimen data held by the source institution.
